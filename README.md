multext-east-msd
================
  
Haskell implementation of the MULTEXT-East morphosyntactic descriptions.

MULTEXT-East encodes values of morphosyntatic attributes in a single string,
sing positional encoding. Each attribute is represented by a single letter at a
predefined position, while non-applicable attributes are represented by
hyphens. For details, refer to the [MULTEXT-East](http://nl.ijs.si/ME) home
page.

The library enables the conversion of strings from/to morphosyntactic
descriptors (MSDs), setting and unsetting of MSD attribute values, and
wildcard MSD matching. Currently, only MULTEXT-East Version 3 is supported,
covering morphosyntactic descriptions for Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, English,
Estonian, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Persian, Polish, Resian, Romanian,
Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, and Ukrainian. For details, refer to the
[MULTEXT-East Version 3](http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V3) home page.
