multext-east-msd
================
  
Haskell implementation of the MULTEXT-East morphosyntactic descriptors.

MULTEXT-East encodes values of morphosyntatic attributes in a single string,
sing positional encoding. Each attribute is represented by a single letter at a
predefined position, while non-applicable attributes are represented by
hyphens. For details, refer to the [MULTEXT-East](http://nl.ijs.si/ME) page.

The package currently only supports MULTEXT-East Version 3.  It covers
morphosyntactic descriptions for Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, English, Estonian,
Hungarian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Persian, Polish, Resian, Romanian, Russian,
Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, and Ukrainian. For details, refer to the
[MULTEXT-East Version 3](http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V3/) page.
