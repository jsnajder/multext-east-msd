================
  
Implementation of the MULTEXT-East Version 3 morphosyntactic descriptors.

MULTEXT-East encodes values of morphosyntatic attributes in a single string,
sing positional encoding. Each attribute is represented by a single letter at a
predefined position, while non-applicable attributes are represented by
hyphens.

MULTEXT-EAST Version 3 covers morphosyntactic descriptions for Bulgarian,
Croatian, Czech, English, Estonian, Hungarian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Persian,
Polish, Resian, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovene, and Ukrainian. For
details, refer to the [MULTEXT-East Version 3](http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V3/) page.
